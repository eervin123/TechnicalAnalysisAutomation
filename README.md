# TechnicalAnalysisAutomation
Python functions for automating technical analysis. 

Important: 
The pyclustering library does not appear to work with the current version of numpy. Also, it doesn't like Apple Silicon (M1 and M2) so you will need to create an i386 terminal using rosetta2 and install your packages into a new env. Instructions can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-conda-environments-for-both-arm64-and-x86-64-on-m1-apple-silicon-147b943ffa55)
and [here is a good one for switching the terminal](https://vineethbharadwaj.medium.com/m1-mac-switching-terminal-between-x86-64-and-arm64-e45f324184d9)

pip install numpy==1.23.1

This numpy version works for me.
